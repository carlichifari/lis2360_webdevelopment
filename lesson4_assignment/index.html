    <p>Carli Chifari is currently attending Florida State University. She is majoring in humanities and 
    is very interested in learning web designs and sales management for the future.</p>

<title> <strong> Overview </strong> </title>

<p>By being a sales manager to me is important for many reasons. 
As a humanities major by being a sales manager qualifies and is important to todays society.
As a society with many job oportunities involving having prior knowledge with achieving growth within a company
and successfully managing a sales team is important. </p>
 <p> With having this kind knowledge with sales management is also important because it 
can help people out with their social skills within a bussiness. By communicating with diffrent types of 
people and companies can also help with networking. By being able to manage recruiting, coaching and performance
of diffrent sales representatives also helps social standpoint. By being able to experince face to face 
interviews of diffrent people can also help distinguish what is right and wrong for the bussiness.</p>
  <p>By being a humanities major, the classes I have taken have helped with these types of bussiness strategies. 
As a society today with so much technology, many bussineses requires you to have a basic education level with technology.
By taking CGS 2060 I learned basic levels of computer and digital technology skills. These skills are necessary to succeed in todays careers.
By taking this class, I learned many new different functions within word and excel that were very useful to me.</p>
  <p>By being a sales manager, you are responsbile for many responsbilities that are useful. By having a strong business sense and proven to have 
excellent mentoring and coaching skills is one of the most important things that required. You are also responsible for expanding the companys customer base and 
make sure it is in good condition. As a person who is very social, by having a job related to this job would be suitable for me.
Eventually I want to start my own bussiness from experiences with other companies. I find this to be very important to have this type of knowledge 
and be able to teach other people the same knowledge I know.</p> </body>
